# Next.js Starter

This is my boilerplate for my next.js project. _Don't take too long to get started!_.

## Features

#### ✅ Typescript
#### ✅ Tailwind.css
#### ✅ TSLint
#### ✅ Path alias resolved
This feature actually needs improvement, still using manual configuration on tsconfig, webpack and jest
#### ✅ Test with [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/ 'Testing Library')
#### ✅ Start with perfect audit
